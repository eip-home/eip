## EIP - Extensible In-band Processing

EIP extends the functionality of IPv6 layer to support the requirements of future Internet services / 6G networks.

In a nutshell, IPv6 nodes can read/write EIP information in packet headers to implement different use cases (e.g. contractual networking, deterministic networking, network slicing).
